# Explanation

- We can create one or more container after run docker image.
- There is something named `docker hub` it is a container registry built for developers and open source contributors to find, use, and share their container images.
- A Docker container is a self-contained, runnable software application or service. On the other hand, a Docker image is the template loaded onto the container to run it, like a set of instructions. You store images for sharing and reuse, but you create and destroy containers over an application's lifecycle.
